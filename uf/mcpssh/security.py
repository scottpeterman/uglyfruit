"""
Security validation and command verification layer for the Netmiko MCP server.

Rules:
1. Default Deny: Nothing is allowed unless it is added to the whitelist (allowed_commands).
   The whitelist is empty by default.
2. The blacklist (denied_commands) has precedence over the whitelist so if both
   blacklist and whitelist match a given command, the command is denied.
3. Pipes are denied by default. Multi-command injection vectors (e.g. `;`, `\\n`, `\\r`,
   `&`) are blocked via the unsafe_chars check before any other validation.
4. Every attempted and executed command is logged for audit and compliance via the
   audit module. validate_command() returns a ValidationResult carrying both the
   boolean decision and a reason constant so the caller can emit a structured audit
   record with the specific rejection cause (unsafe char, deny match, pipe violation,
   no allow match, etc.).
5. Configuration changes are disallowed by default, both at the Netmiko-level
   (no send_config_set) and at the command-validation level.
6. Globbing is supported ("show *") in both the whitelist and the blacklist.
   Glob patterns are converted to regular expressions internally.

Questions:
1. How to handle the command abbreviation issue?
2. Should we support explicit regular expressions in allowed/denied list?
